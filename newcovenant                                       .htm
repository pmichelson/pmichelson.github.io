Welcome to the College Park Church New Covenant Sunday School Class web page, your beloved home away from home, at least for the duration of COVID 19.  Bookmark this page in your browser for future reference.

<p><u>Verse of the Week</u>:
<br>Matthew 6:34 English Standard Version (ESV):  “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”

<p>
<u>Quotation to Think About</u>: 
”For he who has set the limits to our life has at the same time entrusted to us its care. He has provided means and helps to preserve it….Thus if the Lord has committed to us the protection of our life, our duty is to protect it; if he offers helps, to use them; if he forewarns us of dangers, not to plunge headlong; if he makes remedies available, not to neglect them.” 
John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 1, Chapter 17.
