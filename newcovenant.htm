<u>Verse of the Week</u>:
<br>Matthew 6:34 English Standard Version (ESV):  “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”

<p>
<u>Quotation to Think About</u>:
<br>”For he who has set the limits to our life has at the same time entrusted to us its care.  He has provided means and helps to preserve it….Thus if the Lord has committed to ius te protection of our life, our duty is to protect it; if he offers helps, to use them; if he forewarns us of dangers, not to plunge headlong; if he makes remedies available, not to neglect them.”
<br>John Calvin, <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i>, Book 1, Chapter 17.

Welcome to the College Park Church New Covenant Sunday School Class web page, your beloved home away from home, at least for the duration of COVID 19.  Bookmark this page in your browser for future reference.

<p>If you have items (stories, news items, etc.) that you think would be of interest to others in the class, send me a pdf file and I will see about adding it to the site:  <a href="mailto:%20pmichelson@huntington.edu">pmichelson@huntington.edu</a>.

<p>So let's take this baby for a test spin.  For security reasons, the class address list and the class prayer list links are no longer available.  Class members will be sent the pdfs automatically along with the occasional updates.  The list below shows which of these have been sent out by date, so if you didn't get one, let Paul Michelson know and he'll update you.  

<p>Address Lists sent:  April 2020
<br> Prayer Lists sent:  5 April 2020.

<p> Let Paul Michelson know if you spot any errors on the site that need correction.



<p>Enjoy.
