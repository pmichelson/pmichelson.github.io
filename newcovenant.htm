Verse of the Week:
<br>Matthew 6:34 English Standard Version (ESV):  “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”

<p>

Welcome to the College Park Church New Covenant Sunday School Class web page, your beloved home away from home, at least for the duration of COVID 19.  Bookmark this page in your browser for future reference.

<p>If you have items (stories, news items, etc.) that you think would be of interest to others in the class, send me a pdf file and I will see about adding it to the site:  <a href="mailto:%20pmichelson@huntington.edu">pmichelson@huntington.edu</a>.

<p>So let's take this baby for a test spin.  The three links below are for, repectively, the updated class address list, he April  5 edition of our class prayer list, and College Park Church's web site.  Let Paul Michelson know if you spot any errors that need correction.



<p>Enjoy.
