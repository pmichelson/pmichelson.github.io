Kidney Transplant Update as of March 7, 2020
<p>I originally was scheduled to have a kidney transplant on November 5, 2019, at Lutheran Hospital in Ft. Wayne.  Unfortunately, my donor caught a virus and the operation had to be scrubbed. In December, he was cleared but the program had some staffing issues that it needed to deal with which resulted in additional postponement and finally, in February 2020, to a four month hiatus in transplants.
<p>As a result, it has been decided to transfer me to a hospital in Indianapolis.  It is hoped that even with some duplicate testing requiarements, a transplant will be accomplished in the next three months.
