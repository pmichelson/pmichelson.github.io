<h3 style="color: red;">INTRODUCTION:  TOTTERING TOWARD HOPE or 
<br>TEETERING BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR</h3 style="color: red;"></center>

<p>Before I move on to the second anniversary blog below, it seems only appropriate to begin with some reflections on hope.  There is no question that the events of the pandemic years have made hope an increasingly rare commodity.  Thought COVID19 seems to be easing, we still plenty of reasons to be concerned:  war in Ukraine, global inflation, escalating political polarization, and other issues, some imaginary or overblown or principally psychological in nature.  We seem prone to teetering between hope and despair.  Thus it might be timely to continue the ruminations begun in the blog of October 24, 2021 on hope.  

<p>One of today's outstanding academic theologians, Paul S. Fiddes of Oxford University many years ago wrote a first rate essay entitled “The Signs of Hope,” which appeared in Keith W. Clements, et al., <i>A Call to Mind.  Baptist Essays Toward a Theology of Commitment</i> (London:  Baptist Union Press, 1981), pp. 33-45.  In this essay, he called our attention to two kinds of hope:  Secular hope and Christian hope.  Secular hope is an extrapolation to the Future from the Present, a hope in what can reasonably be calculated in scientific terms from the Now derived from current trends.  Of course, as financial analysts make certain they emphasize in their adverts, “past performance cannot guarantee future results.”  And, also of course, logicians tell us that to to make straight line projections from the present to any point in the future is a classic fallacy.  With secular hope frequently running off the cliff, it is no wonder that people alternate between doom and gloom and hope that proves vain.

<p>Christian hope, on the other hand, is not a prediction of what the Future will be, but “the 'desirable future ' rather than the 'calculable future.'”  This is what Jurgen Moltmann called the Theology of Hope, a “hope in a future which is radically <i> different</i> from the present, rather than merely being an extension of the conditions of the present.”  However, “it is important to notice,” Fiddes writes, “that it is promise and not prediction….God always fulfills his promises, but he does so in unexpected ways.”  This is the hope that the Apostle Paul referred to in 1 Corinthians 13, promises based on our faith in God.  

<p>Christian hope is not, as is sometimes charged, an irrational hope.  1 Peter 3:18 tells us that the Christian should “always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.”  (ESV)  This hope must be characterized by gentleness and respect.  In short, it must be reflected in love for others.  

<p>Paul the Apostle, in 1 Thessalonians 5:21, further points out that what Christians have, or ought to have, is a discerning hope, testing everything and holding on to what is good.  Lastly, as Peter goes on to tell us in 2 Peter 3:18, Christian hope is a product of what we might call  “graceful knowledge.”

<p>Reasonable.  Gentle and respectful. Discerning.  Expressing Graceful knowledge.  These elements of Christian hope culminate, according to Fiddes, in the conviction that “God has a certain future in his purpose of reconciling all things with himself” and that “the <i>content</i> of that event depends upon the response of his creatures.”  In the end, “It is an important perspective for the hope of the Church to know that God himself is hopeful.”

<p>Thus, we should look for the signs of hope where ever we are, we should never despair, and we should share our hope with those around us.


 
<h3 style="color: red;">THE TRANSPLANT STORY SO FAR, June 2020-August 2022 </h3 style="color: red;">

<p>On June 24, 2020, I had a kidney transplant with a kidney provided by my youngest son, Paul-Philip Michelson (AKA Paco).  My wife, Jean, served as my exceedingly generous caregiver through out.  To keep friends and acquaintances apprised of my progress, in July 2020 I began this blog, providing excruciating details of the experience.  On June 24, 2022, I successfully completed two years from the transplant.  (For those of you with an unquenchable interest in history, my blog entries for July 2020-June 2022 can be found
<a href="Michelson_Kidney_Blog_2020-2022.htm">here</a>.) 

<p>Successful indeed, such that my transplant doctors gave us approval for a five week trip to Romania and Oxford from June 10 through July 15, 2022.  This trip went splendidly as we were able to participate in the 9th Society for Romanian Studies International Congress on Romanian Studies in Timișoara, June 15-18, and do research at the Angus Library and Archives at Regent's College, Oxford from June 21-July 2 (where we were graciously hosted by my niece and her husband, who live in Old Marston and who took us on excursions to the Cotswolds, the White Horse of Uffington, Stow-on-Wold, the Rollright Stones, Brill, and Blenheim Palace among other delights).  

<p>Working as a team, and with the help of the friendly and competent archivists at the Angus Library, Jean and I were able to completely go through the relevant archives at Regent's College and photograph nearly 2,500 pages of documents relevant to my study of the struggle of Romanian Evangelicals during the interwar period for political and religious rights.  This was the last piece of the puzzle that I needed for my research on what will probably be a smallish book on the subject.  It was an archive that I have been waiting to get to since I became aware of the documents there during COVID.  Now, of course, I need to print off and process the materials….  

<p>We had avoided Heathrow and Gatwick in flying in and out of the UK from and to Romania, which proved to be a wise choice since we did not experience the amazing delays and cancellations elsewhere.  And we left the UK two days before the horrible heatwave (not caused by climate change) struck and the British government collapsed.  Most of the time we were in Oxford it was not only unusually sunny (one afternoon of rain the entire sojourn), but quite cool, usually in the 60s and low 70s.  In fact in on a couple of evenings when we went out, we had to wear sweaters and jackets.

<p>The rest of our time in Europe was spent in Cluj, Romania, where my election as an honorary member of the Romanian Academy's George Barițiu Institute of History in 2020 (the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Institute in 1920) was formally recognized.  We accumulated some 200+ lbs of books; spent quality time with our long-time friends the Neamțiu family who hosted us; do some sightseeing in Cluj and environs, and had the time to leisurely visit and go out to meals with numerous friends in Cluj.  Of course there was a “minor” complication:  C C Neamțiu, our friend of over forty years, wasn't actually in Cluj while we were there (more on this below), but her daughter and son-in-law, Alina and Radu Crișan filled in ably and generously.  We were pretty comfortable in Cluj which is on a Carpathian Mountain plain, while the rest of Romania and Europe was breaking record highs (not caused by climate change).  All in all a great trip with lots of days that one would have to mark with white stones as memorable.

<p>Our flight back was somewhat marred by the fact that our four checked bags didn't make it onto our Frankfurt-Chicago flight, but since since a) they were mostly books, and b) they were never technically lost, we weren't worried about them (more or less).  The fourth bag finally was delivered to Huntington on August 14.  We had left our car with Romanian friends who were in Chicago for summer grants at Wheaton College.  This proved handy for them and for us as they dropped us off in June and picked us up at O'Hare on Friday, July 15, from thence we trundled on home.   

<p>And at the end of July/early August, our dear friend C C Neamțiu came to visit for a week, so we finally got to see her as well.   She was “stranded” the whole time we were in Romania and Cluj in Washington DC, where she had come to visit another of her daughters before her US visa expired.  Then Lufthansa cancelled her return flight for mid-June without explanation (we were told there are basically two reasons: one is that the flight didn't have enough bookings, and the other, that the flight was overbooked.  In any case, C C drew the short straw.  Her daughter eventually found another ticket that would get her back to Cluj a few days before we returned to Cluj from Oxford, but that fell through as well.  Eventually she was able to fly back on August 28.  We had a nice time all in all as Jean was able to take C C around shopping at various bargain venues, which she was delighted to experience.  It turned out that she was about as equally impressed with a typical small American city like Huntington as she was with Gettysburg, the Kennedy Center, New York, DC art galleries, and the like.  Who knew?

<p>On August 18, Paul-Philip had his final session with the transplant team at St. Vincent.  This was his final appointment with them and he was released, having come through the process successfully.  However, I will continue to have at least twice a year checkups from now on out (my next one is in December 2022) as well as doing blood draws quarterly to monitor my transplant and check the levels of various immunosuppresant drugs.  At this point, all looks good.

<p>Some of you have been following my Found Money report on money found during my daily walks.  This will be my final report on that front:  as of the end of August 2022, I have found $7.75.  In addition, I found two 50 bani coins in Romania and a 2 pence coin in the UK.  I appear to be a little short of my goal of the $4,000 needed for the 75” HD TV needed so badly, so I guess I will have to do without.  Maybe I'll buy myself an ice cream sundae instead.

<p>As you might have guessed (or maybe even hoped), this will be the final installment of my transplant blog and will be incorporated into the larger blog mentioned above once all is said and done.  We will send out eMail notes from time to time, including information on our possible October 2022 trip to eastern Romania and Moldova.  And of course, expect to hear from us at Christmas and Easter, as has become traditional.

<p>So now it is time to say thanks to all of you who have stuck with us/me these last two years.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote from a Nazi prison on 13 September 1943:  
<br>“In normal life one is often not at all aware that we always receive infinitely more than we give, and that gratitude is what enriches life.  One easily overestimates the importance of one's own acts and deeds, compared with what we become only through other people.”  (<i>Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works,</i>, Vol. 8, 2010)
<p>I have felt and appreciated your support.  I have also appreciated various kind remarks about the content and tone of my blog;  thanks.  Of course, my highest appreciation on the kidney front goes:  
<ul>
<li>to God for granting me His grace and mercy.  I hope I am not amiss in thinking that this means He still has things He wants me to do.
<li>to my donor, number two son Paul-Philip.  We are pleased that he came through this with flying colors, with the added benefit we found out later that kidney donors turn out to have a longer life expectancy than non-donors.  Doing a good turn for someone else is actually healthier;  how about that? 
<li> to my caregiver, wife, and sweetheart of 55+ years, Jean.  I honestly don't know how transplantees who do not have such a helpmeet can make it.
<li>to the members of the extended wild and crazy Michelson clan.
<li>to our friends, neighbors, and colleagues in Huntington, Indiana, especially at College Park Church, the New Covenant Sunday School Class, and at Huntington University.
<li>to our other Christian friends.  You know who you are.
<li>to our broader circle of friends, acquaintances, and colleagues, most of whom we know through our 50+ years involvement in Romanian studies.
<li>to all of those doctors and nurses involved in my kidney treatment from dialysis to the transplant.  You have been outstanding and are a credit to your medical vocations.  
</ul>
<p>(If I have missed anyone, I plead the well-known propensity of professors of all ages to be absent-minded, which is perfectly normal as opposed to premature senility.)  The encouragement all of you have provided has definitely played a role in the successful outcome of my transplant.  Thank you all.

<p>It would not be up to form if this blog didn't conclude with a few random or not so random thoughts.  Owing to the scholarly pursuits over the last year of our friend, the Inklings scholar Joe Ricke, we have been reading and re-reading some of the writings of C. S. Lewis during World War II, including his important essay “Learning in War-Time,” delivered as a sermon at the University Church at Oxford in October 1939.  (reprinted in C. S. Lewis, <i>Essay Collection:  Literature, Philosophy, and Short Stories,</i> edited by Leslie Walmsley (London:  HarperCollins, 2000), pp. 171-178.)  In this age of COVID19 and actual war in Ukraine, the essay is just as pertinent today as it was then.  Among other things Lewis points out, not only does war makes death real to us, it also invites us to think about our vocations.  Joe's labors are now published in the journal <i>Sehnsucht</i>, Vol. 15 (2021), pp. 55-100.  I also encourage you to follow Joe's moderated ZOOM group, The Inkling Folk Fellowship, whose web site is <a href="
http://www.inklingfolk.org">here</a>.  This group meets Fridays at 4 pm Eastern Standard Time.

<p> C. S. Lewis also wrote a 1948 essay entitled “On Living in the Atomic Age,” (reprinted in C. S. Lewis, <i>Essay Collection:  Faith, Christianity, and the Church</i>, edited by Leslie Walmsley (London:  HarperCollins, 2000), pp. 361-366) in which he argued that atomic destruction, while a very real possibility, should not be allowed to dominate our thoughts and actions.  Instead, we should continue to do “sensible and human things,” such as “praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music” and so forth, an argument similar to that of his 1939 essay.  In the final analysis, “war creates no absolutely new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it,” Lewis writes, “Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice.”  Indeed, “the great Christians of the past...thought it good for us to be always aware of our mortality.” 

<p>But this is not a call to abandon our vocations.  Lewis goes on to say that if the pursuit of learning is valid in peacetime as an approach to divine reality, then it is valid in wartime.  On the other hand, while death is not a novelty, how we face it does matter:  “We must resolutely train ourselves to feel that survival...is not worth having unless it can be had by honourable and merciful means.”  Thus, “Those who care for something else more than civilisation are the only people by whom civilisation is at all likely to be preserved.”

<p>CHRISTMAS GIFT SUGGESTION
<center><img SRC="images/libraryofparadise2022.jpg"></center>
<p>
Usually I avoid crass commercial messages in this intentionally serious and even pompous blog.  However, I can't avoid the following suggestion, which, it should be emphasized, is made entirely free of any considerations of bribery, baksheesh, graft, or nepotism.  So read on.

<p>—Are you deficient in knowledge about ancient Near Eastern Syriac writing and reading?
<p>—Did you think that Late Antique Syrian monks were illiterates?
≤p>—Do you hunger and thirst to know more about Evagrius of Pontus, Abraham of Kashkar, and Babai the Great especially what they thought about reading?
<p>—Did you even know that Syriac is a language?
<p>Well wonder no further.  The answers to all these, and other questions too numerous to mention, can be found in this exciting new book.  Pre-order your copies for Christmas gifts now before they sell out.  Check it out <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-library-of-paradise-9780198836247?cc=us&lang=en&#">here</a>.

All in all,  this is a Middle Eastern page-turner of the highest magnitude and I am looking forward to acquiring my own copy for further enlightenment and amazing reading enjoyment.
