<i><FONT COLOR=”red”><h3>MY KIDNEY TRANSPLANT BLOG</i></h3></FONT>

INTRODUCTION

<p>In July 2020, I began a blog about my kidney transplant, mainly as a convenient means of keeping friends and acquaintances apprised of my progress.  Now that I have completed the first year, I am going to be doing this less frequently, probably only when something more or less significant, important, or interesting happens..  I have decided to divide the blog into two parts:  
<p>

<h3>KIDNEY BLOG, PART I </h3>
<p>Part I covers June 24, 2020 through July 26, 2021, which was my one year + clinic visit, at which point it was decided that all has gone so far well and good. 
<p>To access Part I, click <a href="Michelson_Blog_Part I.htm">here</a>. 

<p>

<h3>KIDNEY BLOG, PART II</h3>
<p>Part II continues the gripping saga from August 2021 to the present. The first installment is dated September 1, 2021.  

<p>
<i><FONT COLOR=”#red”>September 1, 2021 Kidney Update</i></FONT>

<p>Since I am now in the next, “more or less normal for the rest of my life stage” of my kidney transplant, these comments will be more stream of consciousness and random, rather that taking off from lab and clinic visits (the next one of which comes up at the end of October).

<p>Start on a positive (but exhortative) note on FOMO versus JOMO.  Before COVID19, many people were greatly influenced by FOMO, the Fear of Missing Out.  This is social anxiety caused by the fear that others might be having fun when we are not there or connected.  One consequence of this is that we pile mindlessly into social media so that we can stay connected with others and what they are doing virtually minute by minute.  COVID19 offered the possibility of blunting that and opened the way for JOMO, the Joy of Missing out, of being content with your own pursuits and activities, of not checking Twitter or Facebook minute by minute, but actually turning your iPhone off and checking your eMail a couple times a day rather than several times an hour.  So where are you?  Still dreading FOMO?   Remember, the average person has a life span of 4,000 weeks.  What did you do with last week?  Get a life and experience JOMO.  

<p>Moving on to a negative transplant note:  my donor has developed a slight umbilical hernia which currently is not causing him discomfort, but may in the future.  Though susceptibility for such a hernia usually dates from birth, St. Vincent agreed that the transplant surgery likely provoked it and they are going to pay for the reparative surgery and related costs.  Paul-Philip AKA Paco is now scheduled for this surgery on September 20.  This is usually a pretty simple procedure, but there are always exceptions.  We would appreciate your prayers for this surgery.  Otherwise, he is doing well and had basically kept off all the weight he lost prior to the transplant.

<p>On a positive note:  my blood tests and other test measures continue to look fine.  I recently got the results from something called the Allosure test which measures the probability of kidney rejection based on DNA.  The result was lower than in January, which is good.  The probability of rejection is very low.  
<p>I have upped my daily walking goal to over 10,000 steps or from 4 to 5 miles (or 6.5 to 8 km).  The sun is coming up later and later these days, so I usually don't get up quite as early as I did in July and August.  The weather has been delightful lately—between 60º and 65º (15º-18º celsius)—but this is going to end eventually.  Thankfully we aren't in Alaska, where the four seasons of the year are June, July, August, and Winter.  However, last winter I did accumulate a lot of wind and cold protection gear, so bring it on.  (And, of course, I have my indoor exercise bike as a backup.)   As a result of the walking, my weight is coming down somewhat, but I need to lose more.  <img SRC="images/GpaLowynnGma.jpg"  ALIGN=right>

<p>On another positive note:  I got my Moderna booster shot on last week on August 23 (a used-to-be important date in Romanian history).  I had almost no reaction to the first two shots, which indicated that few if any antibodies were actually formed.  This time I had a sore arm for a couple of days, which is good and means that something happened.  I felt a couple of times that I might be running a temperature, but measurements proved that my temperature was actually below what it usually is.  Ha, ha.  The shot will be fully effective September 6.

<p>And we enjoy our nearly 2½ year-old grandson Lowynn, who with his parents live about 30 minutes from here (in Ft. Wayne).  We have been able to frequently visit Lowynn and he is at a fun age.    

<p>We continue to hope to be able to travel to Romania in November, but clouds are beginning to form on the horizon as COVID19 Delta is causing an upward trend in new infections.  In Huntington County, the level is now at Orange which is just one step below Red, with a positivity rate of nearly 13.  And the vaccination rate in Romania is low.  Not good.  

<p>On a fun note, I have two articles in the new issue of <i>Christian History Magazine</i>, Nr. 140, August 2021 on C. S. Lewis' tutor, W. H. Kirkpatrick (“the Great Knock) and Lewis's brother, W. H. Lewis.  A pdf of the issue is available <a href="https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/uploaded/ch140s.pdf">here</a>. 

<p>That's it for now.  Thanks for your support.  And best wishes and good health to you all.
