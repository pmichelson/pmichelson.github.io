<p>

INTRODUCTION

<p>In July 2020, I began a blog about my kidney transplant, mainly as a convenient means of keeping friends and acquaintances apprised of my progress from my kidney transplant on June 24, 2020 to the present.  Having completed the first year, I am going to be doing this less frequently, probably only when something more or less significant, important, or interesting happens or a landmark date has past.  Some or most of you will regard this with a good deal of relief.

<p>The blog is divided into two parts:  
<p>

<h3 style="color: red;">KIDNEY BLOG, PART I:  Year One.  June 24, 2020-July 2021 </h3 style="color: red;">
<p>Part I covers June 24, 2020 through July 26, 2021, which was my one year + clinic visit, at which point it was decided that all has gone so far well and good. 
<p>To access Part I, click <a href="Michelson_Blog_Part I.htm">here</a>.

<p>
<i><style="color: red;"><h2>1.  SEPTEMBER 1, 2021 TRANSPLANT UPDATE</i></h2></style="color: red;">

<p>Since I am now in the next, “more or less normal for the rest of my life stage” of my kidney transplant, these comments will be more stream of consciousness and random, rather that taking off from lab and clinic visits (the next one of which comes up at the end of October).

<p>Start on a positive (but exhortative) note on FOMO versus JOMO.  Before COVID19, many people were greatly influenced by FOMO, the Fear of Missing Out.  This is social anxiety caused by the fear that others might be having fun when we are not there or connected.  One consequence of this is that we pile mindlessly into social media so that we can stay connected with others and what they are doing virtually minute by minute.  COVID19 offered the possibility of blunting that and opened the way for JOMO, the Joy of Missing out, of being content with your own pursuits and activities, of not checking Twitter or Facebook minute by minute, but actually turning your iPhone off and checking your eMail a couple times a day rather than several times an hour.  So where are you?  Still dreading FOMO?   Remember, the average person has a life span of 4,000 weeks.  What did you do with last week?  Get a life and experience JOMO.  

<p>Moving on to a negative transplant note:  my donor has developed a slight umbilical hernia which currently is not causing him discomfort, but may in the future.  Though susceptibility for such a hernia usually dates from birth, St. Vincent agreed that the transplant surgery likely provoked it and they are going to pay for the reparative surgery and related costs.  Paul-Philip AKA Paco is now scheduled for this surgery on September 20.  This is usually a pretty simple procedure, but there are always exceptions.  We would appreciate your prayers for this surgery.  Otherwise, he is doing well and had basically kept off all the weight he lost prior to the transplant.

<p>On a positive note:  my blood tests and other test measures continue to look fine.  I recently got the results from something called the Allosure test which measures the probability of kidney rejection based on DNA.  The result was lower than in January, which is good.  The probability of rejection is very low.  
<p>I have upped my daily walking goal to over 10,000 steps or from 4 to 5 miles (or 6.5 to 8 km).  The sun is coming up later and later these days, so I usually don't get up quite as early as I did in July and August.  The weather has been delightful lately—between 60º and 65º (15º-18º celsius)—but this is going to end eventually.  Thankfully we aren't in Alaska, where the four seasons of the year are June, July, August, and Winter.  However, last winter I did accumulate a lot of wind and cold protection gear, so bring it on.  (And, of course, I have my indoor exercise bike as a backup.)   As a result of the walking, my weight is coming down somewhat, but I need to lose more.  <img SRC="images/GpaLowynnGma.jpg"  ALIGN=right>

<p>On another positive note:  I got my Moderna booster shot on last week on August 23 (a used-to-be important date in Romanian history).  I had almost no reaction to the first two shots, which indicated that few if any antibodies were actually formed.  This time I had a sore arm for a couple of days, which is good and means that something happened.  I felt a couple of times that I might be running a temperature, but measurements proved that my temperature was actually below what it usually is.  Ha, ha.  The shot will be fully effective September 6.

<p>And we enjoy our nearly 2½ year-old grandson Lowynn, who with his parents live about 30 minutes from here (in Ft. Wayne).  We have been able to frequently visit Lowynn and he is at a fun age.    

<p>We continue to hope to be able to travel to Romania in November, but clouds are beginning to form on the horizon as COVID19 Delta is causing an upward trend in new infections.  In Huntington County, the level is now at Orange which is just one step below Red, with a positivity rate of nearly 13.  And the vaccination rate in Romania is low.  Not good.  

<p>On a fun note, I have two articles in the new issue of <i>Christian History Magazine</i>, Nr. 140, August 2021 on C. S. Lewis' tutor, W. H. Kirkpatrick (“the Great Knock) and Lewis's brother, W. H. Lewis.  A pdf of the issue is available <a href="https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/uploaded/ch140s.pdf">here</a>. 

<p>That's it for now.  Thanks for your support.  And best wishes and good health to you all.

<p>

<i><FONT COLOR=”#red”><h2>2.  OCTOBER 24, 2021 TRANSPLANT UPDATE</i></h2></FONT>
<p>Here is my quarterly transplant update.  I had my clinic visit with my doctors via a teleconference on Thursday, October 21, since things seemed pretty normal with my blood draw earlier in the week...and that proved to be the case.  My “new”  kidney is actually functioning better than normal with a BUN at 16 (9 to 21 is standard) and my creatinine at 0.94 (normal is 1.0-2.0).  Both of these are the best they have been since way before my kidney disease struck.  My GFR is at a healthy 78, which indicates no kidney disease.  All my other numbers are good except for a slightly high glucose reading, but it is apparently being controlled with a low dose of insulin.  All in all, a good report.  My next clinic will by in three months.

<p> I am still doing at least 3-5 miles of walking a day.  Since daylight is getting later and later, I have shifted to walking after 8 in the morning and after 5 in the evening, when Jean can walk with me.  When it rains, like today, I still have a stationary bike I can ride inside and watch TV at the same time, so we're good.  I do find walking much more interesting than the bike, but take the less good with the good.  With all the walking, I still need to lose weight, so we are trying to cut down on calories or at least the wrong kind.  We shall see.

<p>Back to kidney transplant-related items.  There are several other items on the docket to report.  First, and most important of all, on my daily walks since last year I have found $2.98 in change so far.  This comes out to a little more than  ½ cent a day.  If I can find another $1277.11, I will be able to buy that new HDTV flatscreen I so badly need.  In addition to the money, I have also found a plastic nickle, a nice marble, an almost new hubcap, a neighbor's school ID card, two round plastic disks that apparently are from one of those spinner things that were trendy a few years ago, and miscellaneous junk worth picking up.  Who says retirement isn't profitable?  Side Note:  I am finding less and less loose change as time passes, which may be an indicator that people are becoming more careful with their money as inflation goes up.  Who knew?

<p>Secondly, as mentioned previously, my kidney donor/son Paco had surgery for an umbilical hernia, which was caused in part by the kidney transplant donation.  Oooff! This was on October 7 in Indianapolis, having been postponed by lack of free ICU space and nurse shortages, both related to COVID19 Delta.  St. Vincent Transplant and the Kidney Donor Foundation paid for all of Paco's costs including the hotel, so that was one less worry.  The surgery was supposed to take 2 ½ hours, but wound up at 3 hours and 45 minutes because once they got in there, they found they needed to repair not only the transplant incision, but also a few other goodies.  These which were not complications as such, but prevented a number of potential complications in the future, so this was a blessing in disguise.  We went down on Wednesday and came back on Friday afternoon.  Lowynn did pretty good with grandpa and grandma and with accepting of the fact that he couldn't see his father in the hospital because of COVID19 restrictions.  Paco is recovering well—he was going up and down stairs the day after, however gingerly, and will be off work for about two weeks—but has developed another rash similar to the one he had with the transplant donation, which is driving him crazy with itching.  Some kind of allergic reaction.  The doctor prescribed some heavy duty cortisone cream that has brought this under control.  We went down for the post-op on October 19 and this went well: half an hour or so and a release by the surgeon to his family doctor.  Your continued prayers are welcomed.

<p>Thirdly, and lastly on the kidney front, we regret that we have had to cancel our planned November Romanian trip, especially for the November 18-20 C. S. Lewis and Kindred Spirits Conference in Iași which we very much wanted to attend.  My kidney doctors advised against it, even though I have had the third Moderna shot (Jean will get her booster this coming week).  They specified that unless I could be certain that the people around me were 1) vaccinated (not good:  only about 25% of Romania is currently vaccinated); 2) people were masked (possibly OK since which we think this might be the case in Romania); and 3) if we could maintain social distancing (pretty much out of the question both flying there and at the conference:  how do you keep 6 feet away from everybody on an airplane?  Not to mention boarding and deplaning?).  We realized that if we are being very cautious in our own city and church, what chance was there that we could do even half that well outside of the country?  Alas.  Needless to say, this is slightly inconvenient (OK, more than inconvenient, but c'est la vie), but obviously better than getting COVID.  We are now hoping to go to Romania in June 2022 for the Timișoara Society for Romanian Studies congress, with visits to Cluj, București, and Iași.  But that by its nature has to be a very tentative plan.  The new MERC tablets might be a game changer. I haven't been to Romania since November 2018 and Jean hasn't been since summer 2016, so we really, really, really want to go soon.  Or it may be that with COVID19, the days of overseas flights are over for people with severely compromised immune systems.  I wonder if we could travel by tramp steamer to Constanța?  Or are we destined to visit only via ZOOM?  We hope not.  We have so many dear friends and colleagues that we wish to see once again.  (Whether they want to see us, however, is another question.)

<p>And now for something completely different.  (BTW if you find philosophical and similar musings boring, inappropriate, or uninteresting, you can skip to the end).  In these days of rising, falling, and then rising and then falling COVID19 and its variants; days of increasingly incompetent political leadership (both in the US and in our “second country” Romania—and, come to think of it, practically everyhere); days when common sense is strikingly uncommon and reasoned discussion has been replaced by shouting (apparently because we equate volume with effective argument) and name calling (apparently because no one seems to remember that <i> ad hominem</i> , personal attack is a fallacy of logic);  days when economic IQs are headed to virtually zero, it is easy to give way to pessimism.  No wonder I rather incline by nature to a short term pessimism, though this is mitigated by a long run optimism.  Pessimists see the glass as half empty; optimists see it as half full.  My view is that perhaps our glasses are too big.  This is no time for foolish pessimism, but it is not time for an equally foolish optimism.  My advice?  If you are a pessimist, lighten up a little.  If you are an optimist, look a little on the dark side.

<p>In this regard, I would recommend to you the great French sociologist, philosopher, and theologian Jacques Ellul's <i> Hope in Time of Abandonment </i> (1977), which begins with this observation from Enrico Castelli:  “Much has been written about hope, almost always in a hopeless manner.” (p. x) This is not unreasonable on the part of those, like the philosopher E. M. Cioran, who have lost The Way, or, to mix our metaphors, who are adrift in a rowboat on an endless and hostile Nietzschean sea with no prospect of getting back to shore, a shore which possibly doesn't even exist.  Ellul notes that “it is quite surprising to observe that those...who reject Christianity as a consolation for the afflicted, as a spiritual succor...vie with one another to find an answer to the material needs of man...by political means.  They reject the idea of God as a 'stopgap' and clearly prefer the psychoanalyst to the confessor.  Yet they readily accept any of the world's courts of appeal (political party, union) as the stopgap.”  (p. viii)  Ellul goes on to point out that modern man's astonishingly naïve materialism has paradoxically managed to become combined with an astonishingly naïve spirituality.  It is important in our present “spineless age” to remember that with the coming and work of Christ, “Hope became near, living and all-embracing.”  This is not just “a theological formula.  It became also the response.”  (pp. viii-x)   Amen to that.

<p>Possibly one thing to be learned from the last two years is that we have gotten too complacent about what constitutes “normal.” It seems clear that COVID challenges our  equanimity.  In the early 1970s, a trendy book was Alvin Toffler and Adelaide Farrell's <i>Future Shock</i> (1970), which sold some 6 million copies.  The key term refers the psychological problems caused by "too much change in too short a period of time."   The main shock for me at that time was that the authors thought they had identified something unusual and “shocking,”when young people of my age (OK, so I was 25 at the time) found nothing unusual about rapid change, which only needed to be sorted out and assimilated where it was lasting and ignored where it was not.  What is shocking about COVID19 is its unpredictability and its politicization.  We are used to change:  personal computers, iPhones, private space travel, 75” flat screen televisions that the average person can now lift by herself or himself (did I mention that I need one or maybe even two of these so I can watch in different rooms?), online dating, electric vehicles, social media, digital books, etc., etc., etc..  Not all of these deserve to be embraced, certainly such as digital books at the expense of book books, but even access to a digital book or pdf is better than no access at all.  Social media, on the other hand, appears more and more to be embraced less and less.  We have become used to change, but not change that we can't predict or control at all.  As for politicization, it is clear that even the most trivial and inconsequential matters are being politicized as politicians become more and more desperate to disguise their misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance.  But enough of that: why should I allow this blog to become politicized through criticizing politicization?  A pox on all their houses.

<p>Life goes on.  We are able to attend church and Sunday school live, but not some of the more social activities, which is unfortunate, but at least we have some of the human connection that is so important for what the New Testament calls <i>koinonia</i>.  Because going to church involves no flying (so far), this is one key aspect of our lives that is slowly moving back to something approximating normalcy.  Other aspects, I'm not so sure.

<p>On a family note, we are grieving yet celebrating the death of my brother-in-law, Mark, who passed away recently from non-COVID pneumonia.  After several bouts with cancer and other afflictions, in the end his body had just worn out at 75.  But, as my sister, Judy, affirmed, because of our Christian faith, this is but the end of the first chapter of a book which will go on eternally, and so his passing is a cause for both mourning (on our part) and rejoicing for him and us of a life well-lived in a deep commitment to Christ.  <i>Memento Mori</i> is from a Christian point of view also the opportunity for celebration of the <i>Evangelium vitae</i>.

<p>I have been busy with working on articles, review articles, and book reviews, so I have been moving very slowly on the unpacking and shelving of the books we brought home from the University this past spring.  I have gradually come to see what books now shelved need to be moved and where the influx should go, so that's something.  The books still on the porch are well-protected from the elements, but probably need to get in the house before snow falls.

<p>On that cheery note, I close this far too long entry in my blog.  Have a nice warm cup of tea (I am currently enjoying something called Yorkshire Gold which is a blend of Assam, Kenyan, and Rwandan teas:  see www.yorkshiretea.co.uk) or coffee (Turkish or Western, your choice).  Put your feet up a bit each day and reflect on the big and little things that you encountered that day.  And think especially of your friends and friendships.

<p>Best.

<i><FONT COLOR=”#red”><h2>3.  FEBRUARY 1, 2022 18 MONTH CHECKUP REPORT</i></h2></FONT>
<p> 

<p>Outstanding News!  Yes, while the rest of you have been huddling indoors and shivering as the weather gets colder and colder and generally feeling miserable, I've been doing my 3-5 miles a day walking and/or exercise biking, and, more importantly, (drumroll please) as of February 1, I have upped my coin collecting total AKA finding money on the streets and sidewalks from $2.99 to $3.45.  Who says exercise doesn't pay off?  A little more and I will be able to retire!  (No, wait, I am retired so I will have to come up with some other idea to expend this surplus value on.)  “<i>Laissez le bon temps rouler!</i>”

<p>This past week, on January 27, I had my 18 month kidney check up and all seems to be going well.  My creatinine and BUN numbers are outstanding, so Kidney #3 is doing fine. They advise more caution again in social contacts because of Omicron, but we have already cut down on what little outside physical contacts we gingerly have had since November. We are fortunate in that we can do this will relatively little discomfort or inconvenience.  Obviously this is not a viable option for most.   My donor has successfully recovered from his followup hernia surgery—which St. Vincent and the Kidney Fund paid all the expenses for—and is back to normal.  My blood sugar has fluctuated unpredictably recently, but the thinking of my endocrinologist this is due to too many carbs and sugar and weight gained over Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The numbers of all three have come down in January and I'm looking forward to a more austere February and March.  Sort of.  To all of you out there who are young enough for this to make difference:  don't abuse your internal organs; they may take their revenge when you are in your 60s and 70s and quit on you.  If you are in your 60s and 70s, it may not be too late to reform your eating and other habits.  It can't hurt.

<p>COVID19 continues to dominate our national and international discourse, and while we cannot ignore the elephant in the room, do we have to endlessly talk about it?  Do we have to unceasingly politicize it?  Do we have to keep talking interminably and hopelessly contradictory about its shape and size? I am sure most of us have heard 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">The Parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant</a>.  <img SRC="images/elephant.jpg"  ALIGN=center>   Asked what an elephant was like, the blind men grabbed various parts of the elephant and declared that he was like a great thick snake (the trunk), a medium snake (the tail), a mighty pillar (the legs), hard, smooth, and tapering (the tusk).  <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/bud/ami/ami14.htm">The Indian version </a> continues:  “Every one proposed his view and they disputed and controverted, and wrangled, and litigated, and bickered, and quarreled, and called each other names, and each one imprecated all the others, and each one denounced all the others, and they abused and scolded, and they anathematized and excommunicated, and finally every one of them swore that every one else was a liar and was cursed on account of his heresies.”  Ha, ha. Those dumb blind guys.  Those dimwitted ancients!  Of course, they didn't have access to the Internet or Facebook or Twitter.  Fortunately for us, we do and we know better and more than any previous generations in history.  How are we doing so far?  Hmm.

<p>But enough of that:  having condemned prattle about COVID19, I prattled anyway.  Here is the real question for us to face, as articulated by Martin Luther King, Jr.:  “What, then, is the answer? We must accept our unwanted and unfortunate circumstance and yet cling to a radiant hope. The answer lies in developing the capacity to accept the finite disappointment and yet cling to the infinite hope.”   Martin Luther King, Jr.  <i>“Unfulfilled Hopes,”</i> 
<a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/draft-chapter-x-shattered-dreams#fn1  ">Sermon Delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, 5 April 1959</a>.  Citing Jeremiah 10: 19, King goes on to say that such an attitude is not fatalism, but the practice of Biblical endurance.  

<p>Among the infinite hopes is that “This, too, shall pass,” as it has in the past.  In 1859, Abraham Lincoln recounted the story of an Eastern ruler who “charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: '<i>And this, too, shall pass away.' </i>How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! -- how consoling in the depths of affliction! "And this, too, shall pass away." And yet let us hope it is not <i> quite </i> true. Let us hope, rather, that by the best cultivation of the physical world, beneath and around us; and the intellectual and moral world within us, we shall secure an individual, social, and political prosperity and happiness, whose course shall be onward and upward, and which, while the earth endures, shall not pass away.” <a href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/fair.htm">"Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society," 30 September 1859, Abraham Lincoln Online, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</a>. 

<p>In the meanwhile, let us Biblically endure. 

<p>Stay healthy my friends.

<b>EASTER WEEK(S) 2022</b>

Easter Ruminations

<p>“All things have become light, never again to set, and the setting has believed in the rising.  This is the new creation.”  St. Clement, Address to the Greeks
<p>

<b>PASCHA MONTH</b>
<br>April is not the cruelest month, as some would say,
<br>Since Easter comes with the sweetness of an April day.
<br>Spring softness is upon the face,
<br>Alive with hints of natural grace.
<br>A warm end to long journey from a winter past grown cold,
<br>On Pascha Morn God warms our souls with His grace of old.

<p>
And what should our reaction to the Miracle of Easter be?  Here is what William Law suggested in one of his letters:  “Give yourself up to ever so many good works, read, preach, pray, visit the sick, build hospitals, clothe the naked, etc….For the new creature in Christ is that one will and one hunger that was in Christ.”

<p>We are taking advantage of your indulgence in reading this blog to wish you a Blessed Easter.  Western Easter was last weekend and this weekend is the Orthodox Easter, so we are celebrating twice.  Last weekend, we went to Nashville TN to visit the Nashville Michelsons.  The Huntington Michelsons and Ft. Wayne Michelsons both were there, so almost the whole family was together except for the two college boys in California.  Grandma staged her traditional Easter Egg Hunt; we had an Easter Dinner, and were indeed thankful we could be together.  On the other hand, we were saddened by the passing of Bethany's mother, Sharry last month.  More <i>Memento Mori</i> but also a time for the Christian virtue of Hope. For Sharry it was an Easter that she could celebrate with her Creator.
<p>

War in Ukraine...and Easter
<br>In general, I have tried to keep this blog from too much political commentary. However, the Juxtapositioning of Easter with the War in Ukraine ought to give all of us pause for thought.  One would hope that the brutal Russian offensive will at least pause for Orthodox Easter. If it doesn't, perhaps that might be an indicator of the sincerity of Putin's alleged Christianity.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainians are demonstrating endurance; one of the Cardinal virtues; it remains to be seen if NATO, the US, and others will be able to do the same.  And, as always, pray and work for peace.

<p>
Endurance and Hope
<br>In my last blog, I mentioned Martin Luther King on Biblical endurance.  Here are a few more reflections on Hope and Endurance:  In Hebrews 12:1, we read “Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us…”  Why?  Because according to Romans 5:4, endurance produces character, and character produces hope.”  And further, in Romans 15:4 “For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.”
<p>
This reminds us that we all need to practice the classical virtues:.  Here, particularly, perseverance, already mentioned as one of the four Cardinal Virtues, and hope, one of the three Theological or Christian Virtues.  At Easter, there is no clearer virtue than hope.
<p>

<b>FOUND MONEY UPDATE</b>
<p>
Now back to the more mundane.  I am pleased to announce that there has been an exciting kickoff to Spring 2022 on the found money front!!!  Since the beginning of the year, the grand total has risen from $3.45 to $4.57.  If I'm not mistaken, this puts me, at least temporarily, well ahead of the current surging inflation rate.  It's possible that some of this money was hidden by snow and hove into sight when the snow melted.  Or maybe people become more careless when Winter fades into well-deserved oblivion and Spring's verdant colors begin to emerge. (If any of you have alternative explanations, let me know.)

<b>EVUSHELD</B>
<p>Apart from my burgeoning found money resources, the biggest personal news this time is that the FDA recently approved on an emergency basis a new monoclonal antibody treatment called Evusheld.  This treatment has been developed particularly for people with suppressed immune systems (such as kidney transplantees) and people with compromised immune systems, both groups for whom the by-now-normal COVID vaccines may or may not work.  If you are not particularly interested in the details behind Evusheld, feel free to skip down to the next entry.

I was able to get the shot (which is not a vaccine) on March 30 without any side effects and less of a stick than a flu shot.  I will keep up my COVID vaccines as well, but these are still of indeterminate effects for immunosuppressed people.  One positive side effect is that we are again thinking about a trip to Romania this summer.  More on that when it is decided.

Otherwise my health seems to be excellent, except for a slight cold (my first cold in over three years).  My creatinine and BUN levels are normal to slightly better than normal, so my new kidney seems to be doing its job.  I drink at least 3 litres of liquid a day.  And I am upping the ante on walking.  Today I reached 430 consecutive days of walking at least 5,000 steps.  I also now have 20 consecutive days with at least 7,000 steps (3 miles+).  In summer, the UV rises quickly, but until 9:30 a.m. or 10:00 a.m. and after 6:00 pm is at acceptable levels, so unless it is raining I am enjoying pleasant walks in the quiet confines of small-town Huntington, Indiana, and its surroundings.

My son, David, has a friend at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Rob Carnahan, who is one of the developers of the Evusheld treatment produced by Astra-Zeneca.  Here is how he explains it:  “...we know the RNA viruses have a propensity to change...so we knew we wanted to go in with what we call a cocktail – which would be two antibodies to distinct sites. The idea being there if you have two antibodies that are at completely different sites, it's very unlikely a virus is going to be able to change two things at once so if it changes one, you have the other side and vice versa. So you're kind of preventing, you're mitigating any kind of escape risk. We're also doing basic science biochemistry experiments looking at this concept called synergy. Which is the idea—could one antibody not only function but could it be combined with another antibody and the sum of the two is greater than either of them individually….we found an antibody partnership where they not only worked well together, they worked as a good cocktail to prevent escape, but they were also synergistic so they would sort of be helping one another function better.”  (Source:  <a href=" https://www.vumc.org/viiii/immuknow/interview-dr-rob-carnahan ">Carnahan Interview</a>)

Here is what Evusheld looks like:

<p>
Evusheld, thus, is two shots, which you are given on opposite sides of the gluteus maximus (“fund” in Romanian for those of you taking notes) simultaneously.  It is not very painful and there are virtually no side effects.  It also has an 80% plus success rate.  Eventually Evusheld will be able to be administered in a doctor's office during a regular visit.  In contrast to mRNA or other COVID vaccines which try to prevent COVID but whose effect is difficult to tell on immunocompromised people, Evusheld is an injected monoclonal antibody drug that launches the body's own therapeutic countermeasures to attack the COVID and other viruses and neutralizes or lessens the impact of COVID.  The two medications in Evusheld are lab-produced proteins which help your immune system to fight an infection. It is particularly valuable for people with damaged or suppressed immune systems.  Unfortunately, it is still in short supply, but eventually the target audience of around 2.4% of the US population will be able to get it.

<b>CODA</b>
Well, that's about it for now.  Mainly good news on the personal front.  Not so good news on the international front (but how does that differ from “normal”?)  And, most of all, good news on the eternal front:  the Good News of Easter, when “Every mystery of Christ's assumed mortality was fulfilled and His immortality alone remained.”  (St. Ambrose).

Best.
