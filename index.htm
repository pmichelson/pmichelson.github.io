<br>One of Transilvania's most distinguished “militant” historians, Silviu Dragomir (1888-1962).  Sent to the Romanian Gulag, 1948-1955.  He survived, but the experience ruined his health.  He was under surveillance by the Securitate from 1955-1960, when his file was closed “for lack evidence.”  </H6>

2020-2022 TRANSPLANT BLOG:  June 24, 2020-December 2022</i></h3></FONT>

<p>I blogged my kidney transplant from the “event” itself through the end of December 2022.  In general, things have gone well, with my kidney numbers (BUN=16, creatinine=.88, and GFR=88) at the last periodic blood draw were the best they have ever been, at least since I was first aware that there were such things.  

<p>For those with an insatiable or morbid curiosity, the entire blog can be perused <a href="Michelson_Kidney_Blog_2020-2022.htm">here</a>.)

<center><h3 style="color: red;">TOTTERING TOWARD HOPE or 
<br>TEETERING BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR</h3 style="color: red;"></center>

<p>A theme that emerged on my transplant journey was hope.  There is no question that the events of the pandemic years have made hope an increasingly rare commodity.  Though COVID19 seems to be moving toward normality, we still have plenty of reasons to be concerned:  war in Ukraine, global inflation, escalating political polarization, and other issues, some imaginary or overblown or principally psychological in nature.  We seem prone to teetering between hope and despair.    

<p>One of today's outstanding academic theologians, Paul S. Fiddes of Oxford University many years ago wrote a first rate essay entitled “The Signs of Hope,” which appeared in Keith W. Clements, et al., <i>A Call to Mind.  Baptist Essays Toward a Theology of Commitment</i> (London:  Baptist Union Press, 1981), pp. 33-45.  In this essay, he called our attention to two kinds of hope:  Secular hope and Christian hope.  Secular hope is an extrapolation to the Future from the Present, a hope in what can reasonably be calculated in scientific terms from the Now derived from current trends. As financial analysts make certain to emphasize in their adverts, “past performance cannot guarantee future results.”  And, also of course, logicians tell us that to to make straight line projections from the present to any point in the future is a classic fallacy.  With secular hope frequently running off the cliff, it is no wonder that people alternate between doom and gloom and hope that proves vain.

<p>Christian hope, on the other hand, is not a prediction of what the Future will be, but and anticipation of “the 'desirable future ' rather than the 'calculable future.'”  This is what Jurgen Moltmann called the Theology of Hope, a “hope in a future which is radically <i> different</i> from the present, rather than merely being an extension of the conditions of the present.”  However, “it is important to notice,” Fiddes writes, “that it is promise and not prediction….God always fulfills his promises, but he does so in unexpected ways.”  This is the hope that the Apostle Paul referred to in 1 Corinthians 13, promises based on our faith in God.  

<p>Christian hope is not, as is sometimes charged, an irrational hope.  1 Peter 3:18 tells us that the Christian “should always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.”  (ESV)  This hope must be characterized by gentleness and respect.  In short, it must be reflected in love for others.  

<p>Paul the Apostle, in 1 Thessalonians 5:21, further points out that what Christians have, or ought to have, is a discerning hope, testing everything and holding on to what is good.  Lastly, as Peter goes on to tell us in 2 Peter 3:18, Christian hope is a product of what we might call  “graceful knowledge.”

<p>Reasonable.  Gentle and respectful. Discerning.  Expressing Graceful knowledge.  These elements of Christian hope culminate, according to Fiddes, in the conviction that “God has a certain future in his purpose of reconciling all things with himself” and that “the <i>content</i> of that event depends upon the response of his creatures.”  In the end, “It is an important perspective for the hope of the Church to know that God himself is hopeful.”

<p>Thus, we should look for the signs of hope where ever we are, we should never despair, and we should share our hope with those around us.  

<Secondly, we should ask ourselves if we might not try to be more reasonable, more gentle, more respectful, and more discerning in our relationships with others.  How about expressing  knowledge more gracefully and expressing more graceful knowledge?  It might do some good.
