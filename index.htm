<i><FONT COLOR=”#DDA0DD”>Kidney Transplant Update, June 24-July 23, 2020</i></FONT>
<p>After futher delays connected with hospitals closing down surgeries because of COVID-19, I was scheduled for a kidney transplant on June 24 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis.  Coincidentally June 24 was also the somewhat mysterious Noapte de Sânziene (Romanians will know what that means.)  Both my donor (youngest son Paco) and myself came through the surgery well and my new only slightly used kidney started functioning beautifully and prolifically immediately.  I was released on June 27, but had to go back in on July 6 to repair some herniated tissue near the main incision.  This also went well and headed off any further complications from a hernia later...which would have been bad.   

<p>July 24 is four weeks since the surgery.  The incision is now completely closed and no longer leaks, seeps, or anything else, and does not hurt when I cough or bend over.  The bulge on the right side where the new kidney was inserted has gone down to the point that I am now symmetrical on left and right.  (BTW, the old kidneys are not removed; they will just atrophy away.)  I like my doctors very much and am pleased with how smoothly St. Vincent's Transplant works.  The usual drill is to visit Indianapolis Mondays and Thursdays for the first several weeks, but another COVID benefit is that they were able to arrange for Thursday's blood draw to be done at Huntington Parkview and if there needed to be discussion of the results we can do this via video conferencing which has become commonplace to avoid COVID issues.  This saves us one trip weekly to Indy, although at 90 minutes the drive isn't excessive.  My fourth week visit with the doctors in Indianapolis was on Monday, July 20.  The surgeons seemed pleased with how things looked and that basically I was back on schedule despite the second surgery.  My numbers are good and the kidney functions at 4 weeks are where they hoped they'ed be at the end of 8 weeks.  (For those who know what this means:  my creatinine level is below 1.0.)

<p>I am eating a lot of stuff previously verboten (think nuts, cheese, TexMex and black beans), and seem to be tolerating the immunosuppresent drugs.  I still lack energy by evening, but this is partly due to the presence of the anesthetics in my system that will take some time to clear and party to a right (my dominant arm and hand)  shoulder injury (deltoid)  I suffered on June 20, but this is gradually getting better (I can now eat with my right hand without noticing) and has a positive knockon effect that I am not at all tempted to lift more that 5 pounds which is my limit until the incisions heal up completely.  (I also now have a lot more sympathy for one-armed people.  I am taking several long walks each day and enjoy the fact that in small town Huntington, one can actually walk several blocks without meeting anybody and needing to mask.

<p>However, in the final anaysis, all of this progress would not be possible without the loving and excessive caregiving of my Jean, who is also the family pharmacist (Jean:  “Here take these pills.”  Me: “Really? All of these?”) and dietician (as in:  Jean: “OK, you've had enough of that.  Eat more of this.”) I frankly don't think things would go very well without such a competent and unflappable caregiver (not to mention driver since I won't be allowed to drive for a while yet).  

<p>And I am grateful to my family for their loving support, starting with my youngest son, Paco AKA Paul-Philip who was the donor (and is recovering nicely, already is allowed to drive, and has his next check up in six weeks).  (A nice fringe benefit is that we see him, his wife, and grandson Lowynn more frequently than anyone else since they are on the same quarentine we are).  The others—my siblings and our Nashville family— have been constant in keeping in touch, making special trips here to help, and so forth.  Thanks guys.  The same can be said about the people at College Park Church and Huntington University.  Our Sunday School class has been especially close and encouraging.  

<p>I now realize that the actual surgery and post op were the easy part and that the next several weeks will have ups and downs and be a bit more of of a slog, but there is light at the end of the tunnel that isn't an approaching train.  I will be semi-isolated until Christmas, especially because of the current COVID crisis, and won't be able to fly until sometime next year, but can get around and will return to a healthier new normal than prior to June 24.  To all of my friends and colleagues, at home and abroad, especially those in Romania, I am grateful for your concern and support.  <i>Soli Deo Gloria</i>.

<p>I had the 5th week + checkup on Monday, 3 August.  I had the stent removed and half of my staples.  The rest will go next week.  When they allow me to drive, I will know that I have gone over the required hurdles.  My blood pressure is normal and stable; ditto my temperature and weight.  The new kidney continues to function admirably and my creatinine level hovers around 1.0, which is excellent.  The weather is exceptional for July/August.  I am walking between three and four miles a day. A fringe benefit of living in small town Huntington (pop. 16000) is that I can walk for a couple of miles in the morning and a couple more at night and not encounter anyone, thus maintaining my semi-quarentine.  My injured right arm is improving day to day, and for some functions (like eating) I can use it without any appreciable discomfort.  All in all, I am doing well.  Thanks be to God.  And thanks to you for your support.

<p>I had the 6th week + checkup on Monday, 11 August, at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.  The rest of the staples were removed successfully.  Because of the healing herneated tissue, I will still have to be cautious about lifting and too much strenous activity, but I can now bathe normally, I have clearance to drive a car, and feel better every day.  My right should (torn anterior deltoid) continues to be a problem, but helps me avoid lifting too much.  I probably will consult a physical therapist for more rehab.

<p>Late spring is gorgeous and our flowers are in full bloom.  I have upped the ante on<IMG SRC=”images/garden.jpg” ALIGN=RIGHT> walking and now do around three miles + (about 5 km) every day.  Small town Huntington is  great for walking because most streets are tree-lined and one usually doesn't meet anybody en route.   Because my immune system is suppressed, I have to avoid direct sunlight, so I have spf shirts and sleeves to cover my arms and a hat to cover my head and neck.  Skin cancer is the nr. 2 problem for kidney transplatees (following rejection of the transplant), so I have keep covered up and have a yearly dermatology exam to check for cancerous growths.  I have never been very sensitive to sunlight, so I am hoping this aspect will go well, but with a suppressed immune system, ones biochemistry changes dramatically.

<p>Blessings.
