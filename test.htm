	Jean Michelson has compiled the following list of prayer concerns as of April 4, 2020.  Let Paul Michelson (pmichelson@huntington.edu) know of additional or amended concerns and he will add it to the list or if an item needs to be deleted.  We will revise this list from time to time.

—Wes and Jean Bell:  Ask God to draw Wes's brother Larry to Him.  
—Dwight and Ann Ericsson:  Request prayer for their grandaughter Danae who is filled with anxiety.  Get her to the help she needs.
—Robert and RoseMarie Waddell:  They are grateful for a nice visit with their daughter Candice who has now returned to North Dakota.  
sd—Diane Waddell:  Strength and Wisdom in these trying times.  Her father passed away and then David had heart trouble.  For the last two weeks she has been caring for her Uncle Max, who is on hospice.  She is very tired and needs sleep and wisdom with end of life decisions with her uncle.
—Jerry and Koneta Wright:  Need guidance in making wise decisions about their internet/computer problems.  Pray for Jerry as he is making progress on his book (now estimated to be several thousand pages long without counting illlustrations).
—Jim and Lorrie O'Donnell: Pray for a safe trip to Texas (left March 23) and good hospital visit for Jim.  Lorrie requests prayer for her son Gabe and current issues.
—Tom and Jan King:  Pray for them as they work with their neighbor who is in declining health.
—Dennis and Jane Kern:  Need continuing prayer for various medical issues.
—Paul and Jean Michelson:  Need God's guidance on transplant matters.  As of last week, all transplants are on hold in Indiana as "non-essential surgery." 
—Allen and Carol Morehead:  Pray for continuing health needs.
—Anne Fetrow:  Pray that she continues to keep her meds regulated and that they might find a larger apartment in Columbus.
